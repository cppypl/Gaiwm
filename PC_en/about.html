            <br>
   

              The Academy was founded by a group of far-sighted North American wealth management pioneers to promote the development of the wealth management industry as a fundamental mission. It emphasizes the combination of theory and practice. By implementing high standards of training systems and teaching systematic practical courses, the professional skills of practitioners have been greatly improved and the duties and obligations of wealth managers can be shouldered earnestly. After years of development, it has set up three series of financial management courses, such as financial planning, wealth management and family office, for wealth management practitioners to adapt to the local needs of mainland China. Therefore, the majority of Chinese wealth managers can receive more international, integrated, and comprehensive vocational ability training, in order to help them provide customers with more pertinent and broader wealth management services, thus promoting the further development of China's domestic wealth management industry.</p>
